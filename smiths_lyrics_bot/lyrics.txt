It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
you made him old

Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now

Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
oh people said
that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong!

Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
oh people said
that you were easily led
and they were half-right

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
you made him old

Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now

Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
oh people see no worth in you
oh but I do

Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
oh people see no worth in you
but I do

I dreamt about you last night
and I fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me
like a butterfly

But take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I

Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly

Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do
As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose

But you've got everything now
you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
so who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...

You are your Mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
but I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen
in the back of your car

A friendship sadly lost?
well, this is true
and yet, it's false
but did I ever tell you, by the way
I never did like your face

But you've got everything now
you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
so who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...

You are your Mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
but I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
So, goodbye
Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine

There's something against us
It's not time
It's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And "love" is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once - twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once - twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
It means: I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
...Whalley Range!
Into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...

I need advice, I need advice
I need advice, I need advice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
Nobody ever looks at me twice

I'm just a country-mile behind
The world

I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...

I'm just a country-mile behind
The world

I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...

Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...

Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...

I need advice, I need advice
Upon the sand, upon the bay
"There is a quick and easy way" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am"

And Sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone

And Pretty Girls Make Graves
Oh...

End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say: "Give in to lust,
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
Soon be dust... "

Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

And Sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone

And Pretty Girls Make Graves
Oh really?
Oh...

I could have been wild and I could have
Been free
But Nature played this trick on me

She wants it Now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate

Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)

I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith in Womanhood
I lost my faith...
Oh...

Hand in glove...
The sun shines out of our behinds...
Oh...
Please don't cry
For the ghost and the storm outside
Will not invade this sacred shrine
Nor infiltrate your mind
My life down I shall lie
If the bogey-man should try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
To tease, torment, and tantalise
Wavering shadows loom
A piano plays in an empty room
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
And when darknesss lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
For you are all that matters
And I'll love you to till the day I die
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Ceiling shadows shimmy by
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wonderous eyes
My life down I shall lie
Should restless spirits try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
I once had a child, and it saved my life
And I never even asked his name
I just looked into his wondrous eyes
And said: "never never never again"
And all too soon I did return
Just like a moth to a flame
So rattle my bones all over the stones
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
Oh, see how words as old as sin
Fit me like a glove
I'm here and here I'll stay
Together we lie, together we pray
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Mine
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy
Although you're only three, sonny boy
You're - you're mine
And your mother she just never knew
Oh, your mother...
As long... as long... as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
As long... as long... as long as... as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
Oh...
Punctured bicycle
on a hillside desolate
will Nature make a man of me yet?

When in this charming car
this charming man

Why pamper life's complexities
when the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?

I would go out tonight
but I haven't got a stitch to wear
this man said "It's gruesome
that someone so handsome should care"

A jumped-up pantry boy
who never knew his place
he said "return the rings"
he knows so much about these things
he knows so much about these things

I would go out tonight
but I haven't got a stitch to wear
this man said "It's gruesome
that someone so handsome should care"

This charming man
this charming man

A jumped-up pantry boy
who never knew his place
he said "return the ring"
he knows so much about these things
he knows so much about these things
he knows so much about these things
I decree today that life is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
ask me why and I'll spit in your eye

But we cannot cling
to the old dreams anymore
no we cannot cling
to those dreams

Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like
the old days anymore
no it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
am I still ill?

Does the body rule the mind
or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

Ask me why and I'll die
oh ask me why and I'll die
and if you must go to work tomorrow
well if I were you I wouldn't bother
for there are brighter sides to life
and I should know because I've seen them
but not very often

Under the iron bridge we kissed
and although I ended up with sore lips
it just wasn't like
the old days anymore
no it wasn't like those days
am I still ill?
am I still ill?
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds

No it's NOT like any other love
This one's different
Because it's us!

Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me

And if the people stare
Then, the people stare
Oh I really don't know
And I really don't care

Hand in glove
The Good People laugh

Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
But we have something they'll never have

Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds

Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
But we have something they'll never have

And if the people stare
Then, the people stare
Oh I really don't know
And I really don't care

So hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath

If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath

For the good life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arm, you little charmer

But I know my luck too well
Yes, I know my luck too well
And I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
All men have secrets and here is mine so let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I think I can rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

So what difference does it make?
So what difference does it make?
It makes none, but now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why? because you asked me to
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
Well, I'm still fond of you

So what difference does it make?
What difference does it make?
It makes none, but now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

Oh the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and then I lied just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you

But no more apologies, no more
No more apologies
I'm too tired, I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you
Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"?
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"

Oh, but you will
For you must

I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

You should not go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"?
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"

But you will
For you must

I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

Too freely on your lips
Words prematurely sad
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight

Life is never kind
Life is never kind
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down

Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down

Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
Oh John, you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for

Edward, see those alluring lights?
Tonight will be your very last night

A woman said: "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"

Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says:
"Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone"

But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death

Hindley wakes and says:
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says:
"Oh, whatever he has done, I have done"

But this is no easy ride
For a child cries:

"Oh, find me... find me, nothing more
We are on a sullen misty moor
We may be dead and we may be gone
But we will be, we will be, we will be, right by your side
Until the day you die
This is no easy ride
We will haunt you when you laugh
Yes, you could say we're a team
You might sleep
You might sleep
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
Oh, you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"

Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for

Oh, find me, find me!
Find me!
I'll haunt you when you laugh
Oh, I'll haunt you when you laugh
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
Oh...
Over the moors, I'm on the moor
Oh, over the moor
Oh, the child is on the moor
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
this town has dragged you down
oh the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
this town has dragged you down

And everybody's got to live their life
and God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine

William, William it was really nothing
William, William it was really nothing
it was your life

How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say:
"Would you like to marry me
and if you like you can buy the ring"
she doesn't care about anything
"Would you like to marry me
and if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone
except myself

William, William it was really nothing
William, William
All men have secrets and here is mine so let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I think I can rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

So what difference does it make?
So what difference does it make?
It makes none, but now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

The devil will find work for idle hands to do

It makes none, but now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

Oh the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and then I lied just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you

But no more apologies, no more
No more apologies
I'm too tired, I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you
My eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wonderkind
you took me behind a disused railway line
and said "I know a place where we can go
where we are not known"
and you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
and this is why you will never care
these things take time
I know that I'm
the most inept that ever slept

I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
and the hills are alive with celibate cries
but you know where you came from
you know where you're going
and you know where you belong
you said I was ill, and you were not wrong

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
and this is why you will never care
these things take time
I know that I'm
the most inept that ever slept

Oh the alcoholic afternoons
when we sat in your room
they meant more to me than any
than any living thing on earth
they had more worth
than any living thing on earth

Vivid and in your prime
you will leave me behind
you will leave me behind
Punctured bicycle
on a hillside desolate
will Nature make a man of me yet?

When in this charming car

I am the son
and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth
how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
just like everybody else does

I am the son

of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and the heir

You shut your mouth
how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved

There's a club if you'd like to go
you could meet somebody who really loves you
so you go, and you stand on your own
and you leave on your own
and you go home, and you cry
and you want to die

When you say it's gonna happen "now"
well, when exactly do you mean?
see I've already waited too long
and all my hope is gone

You shut your mouth
how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
just like everybody else does
All the streets are crammed with things
eager to be held
I know what hands are for
and I'd like to help myself
you ask me the time
but I sense something more
and I would like to give you
what I think you're asking for
you handsome devil
you handsome devil

Let me get my hands
on your mammary glands
and let me get your head
on the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

I crack the whip
and you skip
but you deserve it
you deserve it, deserve it, deserve it

A boy in the bush
is worth two in the hand
I think I can help you get through your exams
oh you handsome devil

Let me get my hands
on your mammary glands
and let me get your head
on the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

I crack the whip
and you skip
but you deserve it
you deserve it, deserve it, deserve it

And when we're in your scholarly room
who will swallow whom?
and when we're in your scholarly room
who will swallow whom?
you handsome devil

Let me get my hands
on your mammary glands
and let me get your head
on the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say

There's more to life than books you know
but not much more
oh you handsome devil
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds

No it's NOT like any other love
This one's different
Because it's us!

Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me

And if the people stare
Then, the people stare

I decree today that life is simply taking and not giving

But we cannot cling

no we cannot cling

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
"You've been in the house too long" she said
And I naturally fled

In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
"You've been in the house too long" she said
And I naturally fled

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die
In a river the colour of lead
immerse a baby's head
wrap her up in the News Of The World
dump her on a doorstep, girl
this night has opened my eyes
and I will never sleep again

You kicked and cried like a bullied child
a grown man of twenty-five
he said he'd cure your ills
but he didn't and he never will
so, save your life
because you've only got one

The dream is gone
but the baby is real
oh you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh you did a bad thing
and I'm not happy
and I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
reminds you of your own again
she took away your troubles
oh but then again she left pain
so please save your life
because you've only got one

The dream is gone
but the baby is real
oh you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh you did a bad thing
and I'm not happy
and I'm not sad
As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose

But you've got everything now
you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
so who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...

You are your Mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
but I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen
in the back of your car

A friendship sadly lost?
well, this is true
and yet, it's false
but did I ever tell you, by the way
I never did like your face

But you've got everything now
you've got everything now
and what a terrible mess I've made of my life
oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
but I've never really heard you laugh
so who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say...

You are your Mother's only son
and you're a desperate one
but I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
to the back of your car
Everyday you must say
so how do I feel about my life
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?

I am sick and I am dull
and I am plain
how dearly I'd love to get carried away
oh but dreams have a knack of just not coming true
and time is against me now

Who and what to blame?
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?
for heaven's sake
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
everyday you must say
how do I feel about the past

Others conquered love - but I ran
I sat in my room and I drew up a plan
but plans can fall through as so often they do
and time is against me now

And there's no one left to blame
tell me when will you
when will you accept your life
the one that you hate
for anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
everyday you must say
how do I feel about my shoes

They make me awkward and plain
how dearly I would love to kick with the fray
but I once had a dream and it never came true
and time is against me now
time is against me now

And there's no one but yourself to blame
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
anything is hard to find
for heaven's sake
anything is hard to find
when you will not open your eyes
when will you accept yourself?
when?
Girl afraid
Where do his intentions lay?
Or does he even have any?

She says:
"He never really looks at me
I give him every opportunity
In the room downstairs
He sat and stared
In the room downstairs
He sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again!"

Boy afraid
Prudence never pays
And everything she wants costs money

"But she doesn't even LIKE me!
And I know because she said so
In the room downstairs
She sat and stared
In the room downstairs
She sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again!"
I would rather not go
back to the old house
I would rather not go
back to the old house
there's too many
bad memories
too many memories

When you cycled by
here began all my dreams
the saddest thing I've ever seen
and you never knew
how much I really liked you
because I never even told you
oh, but I meant to

Are you still there?
or have you moved away?
or have you moved away?

I would love to go
back to the old house
but I never will
I never will
I never will
I never will
It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
you made him old

Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now

Fifteen minutes with you
well, I wouldn't say no
oh people said
that you were virtually dead
and they were so wrong!

Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
oh people said
that you were easily led
and they were half-right

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old

It's time the tale were told
of how you took a child
and you made him old
you made him old

Reel around the fountain
slap me on the patio
I'll take it now

Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
oh people see no worth in you
oh but I do

Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
oh people see no worth in you
but I do

I dreamt about you last night
and I fell out of bed twice
you can pin and mount me
like a butterfly

But take me to the haven of your bed
was something that you never said
two lumps, please
you're the bee's knees
but so am I

Meet me at the fountain
shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly

Fifteen minutes with you
oh I wouldn't say no
people see no worth in you
oh but I do
Good times for a change
see, the luck I've had
can make a good man
turn bad

So please please please
let me, let me, let me
let me get what I want
this time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
see, the life I've had
can make a good man bad

So for once in my life
let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless swines
cemented minds
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old suit since 1962
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up education
as a bad mistake
mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
knees you in the groin
elbow in the face
bruises bigger than dinner plates
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay

Belligerent ghouls
run Manchester schools
spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
jealous of youth
same old jokes since 1902
he does the military two-step
down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
give up life
as a bad mistake
please excuse me from the gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
he grabs and devours
kicks me in the showers
and he grabs and devours
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
The last night of the fair
by the big wheel generator
a boy is stabbed
and his money is grabbed
and the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
she is Famous
she is Funny
an engagement ring
doesn't mean a thing
to a mind consumed by brass (money)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
the last night of the fair
from a seat on a whirling waltzer
her skirt ascends for a watching eye
it's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
then someone falls in love
and someone's beaten up
someone's beaten up
and the senses being dulled are mine
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
this is the last night of the fair
and the grease in the hair
of a speedway operator
is all a tremulous heart requires
a schoolgirl is denied
she said: "How quickly would I die
if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(this means you really love me)
and though I walk home alone
my faith in love is still devout
On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face

A double-bed
And a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor

A double-bed
And a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor

A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on Prisoner's Aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
It's written all over my face

On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

And if you ever need self-validation
Just meet me in the alley by the railway-station
It's written all over my face
What she said:
"How come someone hasn't noticed
that I'm dead
and decided to bury me
God knows, I'm ready"
What she said was sad
but then, all the rejections she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
What she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattooed boy from
Birkenhead
to really really open her eyes)
What she said:
"I smoke 'cos I'm hoping for an
early death
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
What she said:
"I smoke 'cos I'm hoping for an
early death
AND I NEED TO CLING TO SOMETHING !"
Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home
and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home
and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know

It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all

I've seen this happen in other people's
lives
and now it's happening in mine
I am the son
and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth
how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
just like everybody else does

I am the son
and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and the heir
of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth
how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
just like everybody else does

There's a club if you'd like to go
you could meet somebody who really loves you
so you go, and you stand on your own
and you leave on your own
and you go home, and you cry
and you want to die

When you say it's gonna happen "now"
well, when exactly do you mean?
see I've already waited too long
and all my hope is gone

You shut your mouth
how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
just like everybody else does
I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means (of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if the day came when I felt a
natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump
in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound

I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when I felt a
natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump
in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound

And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life
and I think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when I felt a
natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die
Well I wonder
do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry

Well I wonder
do you see me when we pass?
I half-die

Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind

Gasping - but somehow still alive
this is the fierce last stand of all I am

Gasping - dying - but somehow still alive
this is the final stand of all I am

Please keep me in mind
Unruly boys
who will not grow up
must be taken in hand
Unruly girls
who will not settle down
they must be taken in hand

A crack on the head
is what you get for not asking
and a crack on the head
is what you get for asking
Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is MURDER
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It is death for no reason
And death for no reason is MURDER
And the calf that you carve with a smile
Is MURDER
And the turkey you festively slice
Is MURDER
Do you know how animals die?
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not "comforting", "cheery" or "kind"
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
Of MURDER
It's not "natural", "normal" or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour
Of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
Who hears when animals cry?
Farewell to this land's cheerless marches
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing

I say Charles don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?

And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other

Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were

So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing - you should hear me play piano"

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No-one talks about castration

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
These are the things that kill me

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
These are the things that kill me

Passed the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way and it corrodes my soul
I want to leave you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history

Frankly, Mr Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the 21st century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history Mr Shankly

Fame, fame, fatal fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I rather be famous
Than righteous or holy, any day, any day, any day

But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of

Frankly, Mr Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way and it corrodes my soul
Oh, I didn't realise that you wrote poetry
I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry Mr Shankly

Frankly, Mr Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
But still, I must speak frankly, Mr Shankly, give us money
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling
I don't know where else I can go, mother

Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?

Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Although she needs you more than she loves you

And I know it's over
Still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
It's over, it's over, it's over

I know it's over
And it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me and said:

"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know because tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they are in each other's arms"

It's so easy to laugh
It's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
It's over, over, over

It's so easy to laugh
It's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
It's over, over, over

Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I, my love

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
When you walk without ease
On these streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days

And I know that, I know that
I never had no one ever

Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude

I know I'm alone
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone

And I never, never had no one ever
I never had no one ever
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side

A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people all those lives
Where are they now?
With the loves and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived and then they died
Seems so unfair
And I want to cry

You say: "ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well, and I've heard them said
A hundred times, maybe less, maybe more

If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take "on loans"
There's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall

You say: "ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then you then produce the text
From whence was ripped some dizzy whore, 1804

A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side

A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
But you lose because weird lover Wilde is on mine
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said I'd like to
Smash every tooth in your head

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said by rights you should be
Bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt

Bigmouth, bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know of Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt

Bigmouth, bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire for love

How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me
How can they hear me say those words
And still they don't believe me
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?

The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire for love

How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live
How do you start?
Where do you go?
Who do you need to know?
I was minding my business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
To set my eyes on the blistering sight
Of a Vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

A scanty bit of a thing
With a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose
As Rose collects the money in a canister
Who comes sliding down the banister?
The Vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

The monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said : "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again
My God!
The Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh...

The Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh...

The next day in the pulpit
With freedom and ease
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again and again and again

In the fabric of a tutu
Any man could get used to
And I am the living sign
And I'm a living sign
I am a living sign
I'm a living sign
I am a living sign
I'm a living sign
Sign
I am a living sign
Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
Who are young and alive
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore

Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car
Oh please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus
Crashes in to us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
But then a strange fear gripped me
And I just couldn't ask

Take me out tonight
Oh take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
No, I haven't got one

And if a double-decker bus
Crashes in to us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
From the ice-age to the dole-age
There is but one concern
I have just discovered

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls mothers are bigger than other girls mothers

As Antony said to Cleopatra
As he opened a crate of ale
Oh I say

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls mothers are bigger than other girls mothers

"Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on"

"Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on"

And I'll send you mine
Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again?
The Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmere
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself

Burn down the disco
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music they constantly play

On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
Provincial towns you jog 'round
Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ

Shyness is nice, and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to

Shyness is nice, and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to

So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME - I WON'T SAY "NO" - HOW COULD I?

Coyness is nice, and
Coyness can stop you
From saying all the things in
Life you'd like to

So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME - I WON'T SAY "NO" - HOW COULD I?

Spending warm Summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg

ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME

Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb
That will bring us together

Nature is a language - can't you read?
Nature is a language - can't you read?

SO... ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME

Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb
That will bring us together

If it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb
Then it's the Bomb
That will bring us together

SO... ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
Oh, la...
Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
Oh...

You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said I'd like to
Smash every tooth in your head

Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said by rights you should be
Bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt

Bigmouth, bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know of Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt

Bigmouth, bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
Young bones groan
And the rocks below say :
"Throw your skinny body down, son!"

But I'm going to meet the one I love
So please don't stand in my way
Because I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mamma, let me go!

Young bones groan
And the rocks below say :
"Throw your white body down!"

But I'm going to meet the one I love
At last! At last! At last!
I'm going to meet the one I love
La-de-da, la-de-da
No, Mamma, let me go!
No...

I thought that if you had
An acoustic guitar
Then it meant that you were
A Protest Singer
Oh, I can smile about it now
But at the time it was terrible
No, Mamma, let me go
No...
Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
Who are young and alive
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore

And I want to see life
Driving in your car
Oh please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

Learn to love me
Assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow and always
My only weakness is a list of crime
My only weakness is... well, never mind, never mind

Oh, shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over
Hand it over
Hand it over

Learn to love me
And assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow, and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
But last night the plans of a future war
Was all I saw on Channel Four

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over
Hand it over
Hand it over

A heartless hand on my shoulder
A push - and it's over
Alabaster crashes down
(Six months is a long time)
Tried living in the real world
Instead of a shell
But before I began...
I was bored before I even began

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Take over
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire for love

How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me
How can they hear me say those words
And still they don't believe me
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?

The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire for love

How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live
How do you start?
Where do you go?
Who do you need to know?
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I
I want to go to bed

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore

Sing to me
Sing to me
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore

Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go

There is another world
There is a better world
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well...

Bye bye
Bye bye
Bye...
Oh...
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
Oh...

I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
Oh, message received
Loud and clear
Loud and clear
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours

I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
For message received
Loud and clear
Loud and clear
Message received
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours

I wear Black on the outside
'Cause Black is how I feel on the inside
I wear Black on the outside
'Cause Black is how I feel on the inside

And if I seem a little strange
Well, that's because I am
If I seem a little strange
That's because I am

But I know that you would like me
If only you could see me
If only you could meet me

Oh...
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
Mmm...
Oh...
Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six long years
On your trail

Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six full years of my life on your trail

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life :
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y... W.C.A.
I said : "I like it here - can I stay?
I like it here - can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy
For a Back-scrubber?"

She was left behind, and sour
And she wrote to me, equally dour
She said : "In the days when you were
Hopelessly poor
I just liked you more..."

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life :
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y... W.C.A.
I said : "I like it here - can I stay?
I like it here - can I stay?
And do you have a vacancy
For a Back-scrubber?"

Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent too long on your trail
Far too long
Chasing your tail
Oh...

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life :
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
That's the story of my life
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
The story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
The story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story...
All the lies that you make up
What's at the back of your mind?
Oh, your face I can see
And it's desperately kind
But what's at the back of your mind?

Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay
And general decay
Nature must still find a way
So ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile influences sway
This way and that way
This way, that way
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself

Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Let your puny body, lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out and...
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down

As we lie, you say :
Will the world end in the night time?
(I really don't know)
Or will the world end in the day time?
(I really don't know)
And is there any point ever having children?
Oh, I don't know
All I do know is we're Here and it's Now

So... stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you conciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Oh...
Park the car at the side of the road
you should know
time's tide will smother you
and I will too
when you laugh about people who feel so
very lonely
their only desire is to die
well I'm afraid
it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
but that joke isn't funny anymore
it's too close to home
and it's too near the bone
it's too close to home
and it's too near the bone
more than you'll ever know

It was dark as I drove the point home
and on cold leather seats
well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my
face after all

I've seen this happen in other people's
lives
and now it's happening in mine
If you're wondering why
All the love that you long for eludes you
And people are rude and cruel to you
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must suffer and cry for a longer time
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
And I'm telling you now...

If you're wondering why
When all I wanted from life was to be Famous
I have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
But you wouldn't believe me

You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must suffer and cry for a longer time
You just haven't earned it yet, Baby
And I'm telling you now...
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

Today I am remembering the time
When they pulled me back
And held me down
And looked me in the eyes and said
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, my son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must stay on your own for slightly longer
You just haven't earned it yet baby
And I'm telling you now...

You just haven't earned it yet, baby
Oh...
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
Oh...
Oh
A sad fact widely known
The most impassionate song
To a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown
But don't forget the songs
That made you smile
And the songs that made you cry
When you lay in awe
On the bedroom floor
And said : "Oh, oh, smother me Mother..."
No...
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring
La...

The passing of time
And all of its crimes
Is making me sad again
The passing of time
And all of its sickening crimes
Is making me sad again
But don't forget the songs
That made you cry
And the songs that saved your life
Yes, you're older now
And you're a clever swine
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you

The passing of time leaves empty lives
Waiting to be filled (the passing...)
The passing of time
Leaves empty lives
Waiting to be filled
I'm here with the cause
I'm holding the torch
In the corner of your room
Can you hear me?
And when you're dancing and laughing
And finally living
Hear my voice in your head
And think of me kindly
No...
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring
La...
No...
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring

Do you
Love me like you used to?
Oh...
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring
La...

You're clever
Everybody's clever nowadays
You're clever
Everybody's clever nowadays

You are sleeping
You do not want to believe
You are sleeping
You do not want to believe
You are sleeping
You do not want to believe
You are sleeping
Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh my darling
WHY DID YOU CHANGE?

Boy in a million, idol, a big star
I didn't tell you how great you were
I didn't grovel and scream
And rip your brand new jacket at the seams

You made a record, they liked your singing
All of a sudden the phone stops ringing
Ah... I never thought that you would let
The glory make you forget

Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh my darling
WHY DID YOU CHANGE?

Top ten idol, king of your age
Who do you turn to when you're backstage?
Don't you remember you once knew a girl
You loved her more than the world

Is life always like this, brother?
Good for one side but bad for another
I must put you behind me tonight
'Cause you belong to the lights

Those golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh my darling
WHY DID YOU CHANGE?

Oh, oh my darling
WHY?
WHY DID YOU CHANGE?

Oh...
I left the North
I travelled South
I found a tiny house
And I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can kick me
And you can punch me
And you can break my face
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you
Oh...

And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say NO, you say YES
(and you will change your mind)

I left the South
I travelled North
I got confused - I killed a horse
I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can punch me
And you can butt me
And you can break my spine
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you
Oh...

And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say NO, you say YES
(But you will change your mind)

I left the North again
I travelled South again
And I got confused - I killed a nun
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL
I CAN'T HELP THE WAY I FEEL
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell)

Why is the last mile the hardest mile?
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes
And I realised, I realised
I could never
I could never, never, never, go back home again
Is it wrong to want to live on your own?
No, it's not wrong - but I must know
How can someone so young
Sing words so sad?

Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear
And don't go home tonight
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you
The one that you love and who loves you
Oh...

Is it wrong not to always be glad?
No, it's not wrong - but I must add
How can someone so young
Sing words so sad?

Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear
And don't go home tonight
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you
The one that you love and who loves you

Take my hand and off we stride
Oh, la...
You're a girl and I'm a boy
La...
Take my hand and off we stride
Oh, la...
I'm a girl and you're a boy
La...

Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
La...
Throw your homework onto the fire
Come out and find the one that you love
Come out and find the one you love
Learn to love me
Assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow and always
My only weakness is a list of crime
My only weakness is... well, never mind, never mind

Oh, shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over
Hand it over
Hand it over

Learn to love me
And assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow, and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
But last night the plans of a future war
Was all I saw on Channel Four

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over
Hand it over
Hand it over

A heartless hand on my shoulder
A push - and it's over
Alabaster crashes down
(Six months is a long time)
Tried living in the real world
Instead of a shell
But before I began...
I was bored before I even began

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Take over
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he said that he'd never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)

He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he swore that he'll never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)

Poor old man
He had an "accident" with a three-bar fire
But that's OK
Because he wasn't very happy anyway
Poor woman
Strangled in her very own bed as she read
But that's OK
Because she was old and she would have died anyway
DON'T BLAME

The sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never, never, never, never, never do it again
(not until the next time)

Jury, you've heard every word
So before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes
I love you for you, my love, you my love
You my love, you my love
Jury, you've heard every word
But before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes
I love you for you my love, you my love
I love you just for you, my love
Don't blame

The sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And...
"In the midst of life we are in death ETC."

Jury will you free me?

Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
Oh...

You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again?
The Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmere
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's Panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself

Burn down the disco
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music that they constantly play
IT SAYS NOTHING TO ME ABOUT MY LIFE
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music they constantly play

On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
Provincial towns you jog 'round
Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ
HANG THE DJ, HANG THE DJ, HANG THE DJ
HANG THE DJ, HANG THE DJ
HANG THE DJ, HANG THE DJ
Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ
HANG THE DJ, HANG THE DJ
HANG THE DJ, HANG THE DJ
Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ
HANG THE DJ, HANG THE DJ
HANG THE DJ, HANG THE DJ
Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ
HANG THE DJ
Girl afraid
Where do his intentions lay?
Or does he even have any?

She says:
"He never really looks at me
I give him every opportunity
In the room downstairs
He sat and stared
In the room downstairs
He sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again!"

Boy afraid
Prudence never pays
And everything she wants costs money

"But she doesn't even LIKE me!
And I know because she said so
In the room downstairs
She sat and stared
In the room downstairs
She sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again!"
Young bones groan
And the rocks below say :
"Throw your skinny body down, son!"

But I'm going to meet the one I love
So please don't stand in my way
Because I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mamma, let me go!

Young bones groan
And the rocks below say :
"Throw your white body down!"

But I'm going to meet the one I love
At last! At last! At last!
I'm going to meet the one I love
La-de-da, la-de-da
No, Mamma, let me go!
No...

I thought that if you had
An acoustic guitar
Then it meant that you were
A Protest Singer
Oh, I can smile about it now
But at the time it was terrible
No, Mamma, let me go
No...
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
this town has dragged you down
oh the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
this town has dragged you down

And everybody's got to live their life
and God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine

William, William it was really nothing
William, William it was really nothing
it was your life

How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say:
"Would you like to marry me
and if you like you can buy the ring"
she doesn't care about anything
"Would you like to marry me
and if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone
except myself

William, William it was really nothing
William, William
If you're wondering why
All the love that you long for eludes you
And people are rude and cruel to you
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

You just haven't earned it yet, baby

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
"You've been in the house too long" she said
And I naturally fled

In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
"You've been in the house too long" she said
And I naturally fled

In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die
Shyness is nice, and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to

Shyness is nice, and
Shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life
You'd like to

So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME - I WON'T SAY "NO" - HOW COULD I?

Coyness is nice, and
Coyness can stop you
From saying all the things in
Life you'd like to

So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
ASK ME - I WON'T SAY "NO" - HOW COULD I?

Spending warm Summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg

ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME
ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME

Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb
That will bring us together

Nature is a language - can't you read?
Nature is a language - can't you read?

SO... ASK ME, ASK ME, ASK ME

Because if it's not Love
Then it's the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb, the Bomb
That will bring us together

Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh my darling

Oh...
My eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wonderkind
you took me behind a disused railway line
and said "I know a place where we can go
where we are not known"
and you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
and this is why you will never care
these things take time
I know that I'm
the most inept that ever slept

I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
and the hills are alive with celibate cries
but you know where you came from
you know where you're going
and you know where you belong
you said I was ill, and you were not wrong

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
and this is why you will never care
these things take time
I know that I'm
the most inept that ever slept

Oh the alcoholic afternoons
when we sat in your room
they meant more to me than any
than any living thing on earth
they had more worth
than any living thing on earth

Vivid and in your prime
you will leave me behind
you will leave me behind
A sad fact widely known
The most impassionate song
To a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown
But don't forget the songs
That made you smile
And the songs that made you cry
When you lay in awe
On the bedroom floor
And said : "Oh, oh, smother me Mother..."

Yes, you're older now
And you're a clever swine
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you

Hear my voice in your head
And think of me kindly
No...
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring

No...
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring

Do you
Love me like you used to?
Oh...
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring
La...

You're clever
Everybody's clever nowadays
You're clever
Everybody's clever nowadays

You are sleeping
You do not want to believe
You are sleeping
You do not want to believe
You are sleeping
You do not want to believe
You are sleeping
I would rather not go
back to the old house
I would rather not go
back to the old house
there's too many
bad memories
too many memories

When you cycled by
here began all my dreams
the saddest thing I've ever seen
and you never knew
how much I really liked you
because I never even told you
oh, but I meant to

Are you still there?
or have you moved away?
or have you moved away?

I would love to go
back to the old house
but I never will
I never will
I never will
I never will
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds

No it's NOT like any other love
This one's different
Because it's us!

Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me

And if the people stare
Then, the people stare
Oh I really don't know
And I really don't care

Hand in glove
The Good People laugh

Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
But we have something they'll never have

Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds

Yes, we may be hidden by "rags"
But we have something they'll never have

And if the people stare
Then, the people stare
Oh I really don't know
And I really don't care

So hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath

If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath

For the good life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arm, you little charmer

But I know my luck too well
Yes, I know my luck too well
And I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
On the high-rise estate
What's at the back of your mind?
Oh, a three-day debate
On a high-rise estate
What's at the back of your mind?

Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay
And general decay
Nature must still find a way
So ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile influences sway
This way and that way (this way)
This way and that way (this way)
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself

Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Oh... let your puny body, lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out and...
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Oh... let your puny body lie down, lie down

As we lie, you say :
Will the world end in the night time?
(I really don't know)
Or will the world end in the day time?
(I really don't know)
And is there any point ever having children?
Oh, I don't know
What I do know is we're Here and it's Now

So... stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you conciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Good times for a change
see, the luck I've had
can make a good man
turn bad

So please please please
let me, let me, let me
let me get what I want
this time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
see, the life I've had
can make a good man bad

So for once in my life
let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
In a river the colour of lead
immerse a baby's head
wrap her up in the News Of The World
dump her on a doorstep, girl
this night has opened my eyes
and I will never sleep again

You kicked and cried like a bullied child
a grown man of twenty-five
he said he'd cure your ills
but he didn't and he never will
so, save your life
because you've only got one

The dream is gone
but the baby is real
oh you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh you did a bad thing
and I'm not happy
and I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
reminds you of your own again
she took away your troubles
oh but then again she left pain
so please save your life
because you've only got one

The dream is gone
but the baby is real
oh you did a good thing
she could have been a poet
or, she could have been a fool
oh you did a bad thing
and I'm not happy
and I'm not sad
Oh...
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
Oh...

I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
Oh, message received
Loud and clear
Loud and clear
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours

I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
For message received
Loud and clear
Loud and clear
Message received
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours

I wear Black on the outside
'Cause Black is how I feel on the inside
I wear Black on the outside
'Cause Black is how I feel on the inside

And if I seem a little strange
Well, that's because I am
If I seem a little strange
That's because I am

But I know that you would like me
If only you could see me
If only you could meet me

Oh...
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
Mmm...
Oh...
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I
I want to go to bed

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore

Sing to me
Sing to me
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore

Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go

There is another world
There is a better world
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well...

Bye bye
Bye bye
Bye...
HELLO
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
Hung by his pretty white neck
Some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
But I missed my bed
So I soon came home
They said:
"there's too much caffeine
In your blood stream
And a lack of real spice
In your life"
I said:
"leave me alone because I'm alright, dad
Just surprised to still be on my own...."
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the strain of the pain again
A rush and a push and the land that
We stand on is ours
It has been before
So it shall be again
And people who are uglier than you and I
They take what they need, and leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again
A rush and a push and the land that
We stand on is ours
It has been before
So why can't it be now?
And people who are weaker than you and I
They take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
No - just don't mention love!
A rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
Your youth may be gone
But you're still a yound man
So phone me, phone me, phone me
So phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv
The lanes were silent
With nothing or no one around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
With a hard-faced
Three-word gesture
I started something
I forced you into a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
That's what Tradition means
And I doused another venture
With a gesture
That was...absolutly vile
I started something
Forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...and now I'm not too sure
I garbbed you by the guilded beams
That's what Tradition means
And now eighteen months' hard-labour
Seems..fair enough
I started something
Forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
And now I'm not too sure
The death of a disco dancer
Well, it happens a lot 'round here
And if you think Peace
Is a common goal
Well, that goes to show
Just how little you know
The death of a disco dancer
Well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd just rather not get involved
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
...but maybe in the next world
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious
There were times
When I could
Have 'murdered' her
(but, you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her)
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
There were times when I could
Have 'strangled' her
(but, you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her)
WOULD YOU PLEASE
LET ME SEE HER!
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Let me whisper my last goodbyes

I know - IT'S SERIOUS
Stop me, oh, oh-o, stop me
Stop me if you think
That you've heard this one before

Stop me, oh, oh-o, stop me
Stop me if you think
That you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar

And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said lied I'd to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied?
Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied?
Because I never

I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen and broke my knee
And then he really lays into me
Friday night in out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied?
Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied?
Because I never

And so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor
I drank more

Stop me, oh, oh-o, stop me
Stop me if you think
That you've heard this one before

Stop me, oh, oh-o, stop me
Stop me if you think
That you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
Only slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love
Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope - but no harm
Just another false alarm
Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope - no harm
Just another false alarm
So, tell me how long
Before the last one?
And tell me how long
Before the right one?
This story is old - I KNOW
But it goes on
This story is old - I KNOW
But it goes on
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Because you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
And some may say
When usuallly its Nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?
I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
And: "May the lines sag heavy
And deep tonight"
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Becasue you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
Some people say
When usually its Nothing
Surly you're happy
It should be this way?
I said "No"
And then I shot myself
So, drink, drink, drink
And be ill tonight
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
And ooh, the plans they weave
And ooh, the sickening greed
At the record company party
On their hands - a dead star
The sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
Double pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them, please them!"
(Sadly, THIS was your life)
But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have said no
If you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them!, Please them!"
(Sadly, this was your life)
But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have walked away
... couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
You had no real way of knowing
In my heart I begged "take me with you...
I don't care where you're going..."
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
A child from those ugly new houses
Who could never begin to know
Who could never really know
Best of! Most of!
Satiate the need
Slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and feel deceived
Climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(THIS was your life...)
And when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
You're just the same as I am
What makes most people feel happy
Leads us headlong into harm
So, in my bedroom in those ugly new houses
I dance my legs down to the knees
But me and my 'true love'
Will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
On their hands - at last! - a dead star!
But they can never taint you in my eyes
They can never touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you my darling
They cannot touch you now
But me and my 'true love'
Will never meet again
Ooh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Because there's somebody here
Who really really loves you
Stay home
Be bored
(it's crap, I KNOW)
Ooh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Ooh, Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Because there's somebody here
Who'll take a hatchet to your ear
How the frustration renders me
Hateful, Glenn!
Don't come to the house tonight
Don't come to the house tonight
Because you'll slip on the
Trail of my bespattered remains
And so, that's why
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE
I won't share you
I won't share you
With the drive
The ambition
And the zeal I feel
This is my time
As the note I wrote
Was read, she said
Has the Perrier gone
Straight to my head
Or is life plainly sick and cruel, instead?
"YES!"
No - no - no - no - no - no
I won't share you
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time
Life tends to come and go
Well, that's OK
Just as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
Well, that's OK
Just as long as you know
I won't share you
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time
This is my time
